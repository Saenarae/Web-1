<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
  WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald E. <br>
  Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming":<br>
  the idea that one could create software as works of literature, <br>
  by embedding source code inside descriptive text, <br>
  rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages),<br>
  in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers,<br>
  rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.<br>
